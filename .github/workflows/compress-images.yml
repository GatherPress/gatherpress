# Image Actions will run in the following scenarios:
# - on Pull Requests containing images (not including forks)
# - on demand (https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/)
# For Pull Requests, the images are added to the PR.
# For other scenarios, a new PR will be opened if any images are compressed.
