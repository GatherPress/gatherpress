      # This is kind of a hack PART 1/2,
      # to make sure Playwright DOES NOT start the webserver on its own.
      #
      # Part 2/2 is the "command: undefined," declaration
      # in .github/scripts/wordpress-org-screenshots/playwright.config.ts
      #
      # While auto-loading the webserver when needed sounded nice, it introduced a race-condition
      # between the setup of Playground and Playwrights own start event.
      # Playwright listens for the availability of the webserver relatively simple,
      # as soon as there is a status code 200, Playwright starts all engines.
      #
      # Unfortunately Playground is not ready at this point, it hast started WordPress
      # and is going to start stepping through the blueprint, but hasn't loaded GatherPress nor imported any data;
      # Resulting in failing tests.
      #
      # It was not possible (for me) to keep the setup of Playground in a separate step,
      # why this "run > sleep > run" became necessary.
      # The setup process usually takes about 20sec, so 60 is just a good extra, to not run into errors.
      #
      # The sleep step, should help making sure Playwright runs only, when this is DONE & READY.
