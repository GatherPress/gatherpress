# Dependency Review Action
#
# This Action will scan dependency manifest files that change as part of a Pull Request, surfacing known-incompatible licenses and/or known-vulnerable versions of the packages declared or updated in the PR. Once installed, if the workflow run is marked as required, PRs introducing known-incompatible licenses or known-vulnerable packages will be blocked from merging.

        # Version 4.3.4 does not work with invalid license names in the config and since that version,
        # SPDX expression licenses are considered invalid (see: https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/issues/792).
        # In short, remove all SPDX expressions from the config!
        #
        # Note that if you have packages that use SPDX expressions, this will report them as invalid,
        # as support is not yet implemented (see: https://github.com/actions/dependency-review-action/issues/263).
        #
        # In that case you need to downgrade to version 4.3.3 where SPDX expressions are handled as exact strings !!
