# Configuration

Once activated, GatherPress can be configured from your WordPress dashboard under **Events > Settings**.

## ⚙️ General Settings

Customize how GatherPress behaves across your site:

- Use publish date as event date (optional)
- Default RSVP limit
- Enable or disable anonymous RSVPs
- Date and time formats
- Display timezone for events
- Set pages for Upcoming and Past Events listings

## 🗓️ Creating an Event

Go to **Events > Add New**. The event editor uses WordPress blocks. You can add, remove, or rearrange blocks freely.

### Common Event Blocks

- **Event Date** – Set start/end dates, times, and timezone
- **Venue** – Select in-person or online; configure map options
- **RSVP** – Allow users to RSVP “yes” or “no”
- **RSVP Response** – Display attendees/non-attendees
- **Add to Calendar** – Let users export events to their calendar

## 📍 Creating a Venue

Go to **Events > Venues** and fill in:

- Full address, phone, website
- Map settings (type, zoom level, height)

## 🏷️ Creating Event Topics

Go to **Events > Topics** to add or manage topics (like categories for events). These help with filtering and discovery.
