# GatherPress

GatherPress is the result of the WordPress community's frustrated with event management tools that have not met the diverse needs of organizers and members.

This project is for the collaborative effort to build a compelling event management application using open source tools such as _WordPress_ and _BuddyPress_ and the grit sweat and love of **the community, for the community**. 

We're creating the very network features we need to host events and gather well.
