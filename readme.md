## Description

GatherPress, a plugin created by and for the WordPress community, is a response to the community's desire for novel event management tools that meet the diverse needs of event organizers and members. Its agenda and roadmap align with that of the WordPress community, ensuring that it evolves in tandem with our collective wants and needs.

## Pilot Program

**We propose a pilot program to test GatherPress**, a community-developed plugin, within interested and active WordPress meetup groups. This initiative stems from our community’s need for an innovative event management tool tailored to the unique demands of WordPress event organizers and participants. Our proposal in January 2024 on [make.wordpress.org](https://make.wordpress.org/community/2024/01/22/proposal-pilot-program-to-test-gatherpress-on-the-wordpress-org-network-as-a-meetup-alternative/)

## Community-built

This project is the result of a collaborative effort to build a compelling event management application using open source tools such as _WordPress_ and _BuddyPress_ and with the grit, sweat, and love of **the community, for the community**. We encourage all interested, whether a user, community member, or developer, to follow our emerging presence on our [GatherPress Blog](https://gatherpress.org/blog/), our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/GatherPress/), our [GatherPress Documentation](https://gatherpress.org/documentation/), or new features on our [GatherPress Playground](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gatherpress/?preview=1).

## Playground Environment

The GatherPress Playground allows you to test the current state of GatherPress with existing data in a fully-functional environment.

![GatherPress Playground screenshot](./docs/media/playground-plugins-link.png)

The playground is built on the WordPress Playground with customizable json data that you can customize as you like. To get started, click the [button above](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gatherpress/?preview=1), or delve deeper by:

- Clicking the “Live Preview” button on WordPress.org GatherPress plugin page
- Instantly previewing changes from a commented Playground-link on each PR
- Automatically generating multilingual screenshots for WordPress.org plugins
- Run end-to-end tests (still a PR)
- Curating and maintaining your own set of demo-data, which is reusable in all WP Playgrounds.

For an introduction as to what we are creating and the specific features needed to host events and gather well, please view the [introductory video](https://gatherpress.org/demovideo).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What external services are used in GatherPress?

- Mapping Services: We use OpenStreetMap and Google Maps to display meeting locations on a map. To achieve this, we send the address to OpenStreetMap or Google Maps for rendering.
- Calendar Integration: GatherPress also supports "Add to Calendar" functionality using Google Calendar and Yahoo! Calendar.

### What about a PRO version?

As a Community powered plugin, GatherPress is already the PRO-version.

Because we strive for close-to-core development, love decisions - not options and follow a lot of well known best-practices within the WordPress space, we can and do focus on what matters most - powering our community's event management needs.

### Is GatherPress WordPress Multisite compatible?

Yes, GatherPress can be run on a network of sites. The additional database tables it needs, will be created automatically for each new site if the plugin is network-activated.

GatherPress can also be activated per site.

## GatherPress‘ Best Practices

- Tested & validated against [WordPress Coding Standards](https://developer.wordpress.org/coding-standards/wordpress-coding-standards/)
- Not only once, but consequently tested & validated against the [WordPress plugin review guidelines](https://github.com/WordPress/plugin-check-action).
- [JavaScript & PHP Unit tests](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=GatherPress_gatherpress&branch=main) are covering almost 80% of the whole codebase.

## Reminder -- GatherPress is still in Alpha

As we continue to refine and develop the core plugin, we've created the [GatherPress Alpha](https://github.com/GatherPress/gatherpress-alpha) plugin to run alongside the GatherPress plugin. The role of the Alpha plugin is to manage breaking changes easily: just make sure it is up-to-date, activate it, go to the Alpha section under GatherPress Settings, and click "Fix GatherPress!" after updating GatherPress. This process helps us avoid technical debt as we work towards launching version 1.0.0 of the plugin. When we arrive there, the Alpha plugin will no longer be necessary.
